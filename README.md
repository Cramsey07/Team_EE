Project Description:

This program determines whether a user is a civilian or a staff member and provides different option menus based on their selection. Civilians can choose from several options, receive information, and decide whether to continue after each step. Staff members must enter a correct password within two attempts, then may need to provide a valid employee ID to access certain features. After viewing data, both civilians and staff are asked if they want to continue, and the program ends if they respond with anything other than “yes".

Created a password so that access is granted to those who enter correct passwords.

Docker is used in order to push code to the cloud. It allows user with allowed acess to see and use the program made. It keeps the code in a container, and then when asked, will turn that code into a image, to show the program.

By using docker and running the program, the action then is added to the github repository. It displays the dockerfile on github, and keeps the code in an organized place. This creates a YML which can be used on github.

Java docs allow teams to comment and communicate through a project by allowing comments and communications to be translated in multiple coding languages.

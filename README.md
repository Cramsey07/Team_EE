This project is all about the department of defense. The goal of this program is to pick out and show specific data related to weather or not the user is staff or civilian. If the user picks Civilian, it will be given a sequence of options and pick from them. According to their answer, it will give them info, and then ask the user if they want to continue, after every option. If the user says something other than "yes", then the Civilian class will end. On the other hand, the Staff class goes more in depth. Once the user picks staff, it will ask them for a password. If the user enters an invalid password twice or more, then the entire program will end. If the user enters a correct password, the program will continue and show options. 2 of 3 of the options will require employee ID to continue. Once the user enters a correct employee ID without any limited number or attempts, it will show a list of options similar to the Civilian class. Once the staff memeber has selected an option, it will show the data and the ask the user if they want to continue. If the user says yes, it will repeat the prompt but if the user says no, or anything else, the program will end.

Created a password so that access is granted to those who enter correct passwords.

Docker is used in order to push code to the cloud. It allows user with allowed acess to see and use the program made. It keeps the code in a container, and then when asked, will turn that code into a image, to show the program.

By using docker and running the program, the action then is added to the github repository. It displays the dockerfile on github, and keeps the code in an organized place. This creates a YML which can be used on github.

Java docs allow teams to comment and communicate through a project by allowing comments and communications to be translated in multiple coding languages.
